This is a utility project that leverages Moxie Marlinspike and others work to create a single hop TOR Tunnel 

Tor Tunnel (thoughtcrime.org)

As a helper I created a crontab to run this every day at 02:15
crontab -e
# m h  dom mon dow   command
15 02 * * * /home/darbym/extractTorExitNodes

This project includes a sample version of the IP2Location database, most if 
not all of the ips will not be found and will print a "-" as the country the 
subscription can be bought for $49/yr if you want it.
